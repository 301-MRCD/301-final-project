## Overview
Our final project for codefellows 301 

**User Story:** As a dog owner, I want to be able to find a list of dog parks in the seattle area.  Iâ€™d like to be able to filter these parks by different criteria such as dog size, terrain (i.e. beach, forest) off-leash, and other useful criteria.  I also want to be able to find nearby dog-friendly businesses I can take my dogs to on doggy dates after the park!  I would also like to be able to save a list of my favorite parks and be able to reference them later.  

## Getting Started

**Notes:** Last night we set up the basic scaffolding for our site and made sure all the routes were semantically named and wired up correctly.  Tested a basic yelp API call and confirmed proof of life.  Goal for today was to get our results page rendered with accurate JSON data from the Yelp API as well as details.
