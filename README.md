**User Story:** As a dog owner, I want to be able to find a list of dog parks in the seattle area.  Iâ€™d like to be able to filter these parks by different criteria such as dog size, terrain (i.e. beach, forest) off-leash, and other useful criteria.  I also want to be able to find nearby dog-friendly businesses I can take my dogs to on doggy dates after the park!  I would also like to be able to save a list of my favorite parks and be able to reference them later.
