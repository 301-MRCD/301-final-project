            I am a Seattle-based software developer with a focus in full stack
            javascript development. Prior to pursuing this career, I spent five
            years working in special education. During this time, I worked with
            diverse populations throughout various Seattle communities. Working
            within a team, I developed plans to make meaningful programmatic
            changes in order to meet designated goals.

            <br />

            I love learning new technologies, building applications that are
            accessible for users of all backgrounds, and I am excited to
            continue building my understanding of pairing efficient logic with
            intuitive user interface.
